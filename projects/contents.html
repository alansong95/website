                        <p>Smart picture frame is an IoT picture frame that you can speak to. A user can command the device to take a picture and look through the pictures taken using his or her voice. Unlike a traditional picture frame, a user does not need to take a picture and print it out to display, which takes a long time. With this device, a user can take a picture at any time and display it instantly.</p>
